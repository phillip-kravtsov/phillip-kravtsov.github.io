Hello! While I've set up this website, I've yet to finish it.

I'm a second year undergrad at UC Berkeley, studing Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm focusing my studies on the multimodally exciting field of machine learning. I am currently a research assitant in [*Dawn Song's Lab*](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/). I have also spent much of my time at Berkeley working on various aspects of [*Machine Learning at Berkeley*](https://ml.berkeley.edu/), an eighty-strong student organization which fosters the ML community at Cal by consulting with industry partners, conducting research with labs, and hosting numerous events on campus.

Outside of my technical interests, I am an avid aquascaper, currently working on an ADA 60P layout.
