Hello! While I've set up this website, I've yet to finish it.

I'm a second year undergrad at UC Berkeley, studing Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm focusing my studies on the multimodally exciting field of machine learning. Currently, I'm a research assitant in [Dawn Song's Lab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/). I have also spent much of my time at Berkeley working on various aspects of [Machine Learning at Berkeley](https://ml.berkeley.edu/), an eighty-strong student organization which fosters the ML community at Cal by consulting with industry partners, conducting research with labs, and hosting numerous events on campus.

I grew up in the temperate partially-agricultural beach town of Arroyo Grande, California where I subconsciously learned to appreciate the beauty of sunny days, undisturbed nature, and traffic-free highways. Outside of my technical interests, I'm an avid aquascaper, currently working on a freshwater densely planted ADA 60P layout (pictures soon to follow).
